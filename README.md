# lempel-ziv

In this project I compressed el Quijote by Miguel de Cervantes using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) compression algorithm. The filesize after compression should be 1MB while the initial filesize is 2.1MB. If you want the code to work you should execute the script compression.py to compress the file and then decompression.py to decompress the file. It can also compress any txt files in the latin alphabet.
