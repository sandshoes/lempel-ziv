# lempel-ziv

In this project I compressed el Quijote by Miguel de Cervantes using the Lempel-Ziv (LZ77) compression algorithm. The filesize after compression should be 1MB while the initial filesize is 2.1MB. If you want the code to work you should execute the script finalcomp.py to compress the file and then finaldecomp.py to decompress the file. It can also compress txt files in the latin alphabet shorter than el Quijote. Currently working to make it available for very big txt files.
